 mf_positive_personality.EVTNAME1:0 "A Diamond in the Rough"
 mf_positive_personality.EVTDESC1:0 "While inspecting our armies, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], thanks to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] keen eye for talent, identified one remarkable individual who [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] believed possessed great potential. Upon summoning him to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] residence, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] became certain of this soldier's ability. The only question that remains concerns what capacity this individual shall serve in our state."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTA1:0 "Let him reform our armies."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTB1:0 "Let him organize our ranks."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTC1:0 "Let him drill our soldiers."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTNAME2:0 "Banquet for a Neighbor"
 mf_positive_personality.EVTDESC2:0 "During one of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s usual extravagant parties, a certain [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] of the neighboring nation of [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.TAG.GetName] was also invited to the banquet. Fortunately for us, the gold that would be typically wasted in such a banquet as this was put to good use, as [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] was very pleased with our lavish display and high quality of food, and the [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] is sure to attend our banquets again in the future... should our relations remain friendly, of course." 
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTA2:0 "Tell [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetSheHe] is welcome here."
 mf_positive_personality.3.t: "For Sturdier Walls"
 mf_positive_personality.3.desc: "As an expert in all earthworks, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently noticed some gaps in the defenses of our fortress in [earthwork_event_target.GetName]. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thus immediately dispatched officials to survey the fortifications and begin renovations and expansions of its walls. Such improvements shall surely last us for quite some time before they must be renovated once more."
 mf_positive_personality.3.a: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s engineering eye is unmatched."
 mf_positive_personality.3.b: "Perhaps we can invest more resources into the project."
 mf_positive_personality.4.t: "A Lover in the Court?"
 mf_positive_personality.4.desc: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s reputation as a charismatic seducer has paid off for once. One of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s lovers is a prominent member of our society, and it just so happens that they have a number of different talents and interests across various fields. Thanks to their close relationship with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], they have entered the court as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] trusted confidant."
 mf_positive_personality.4.a: "Their in-depth knowledge of schools of thought shall be useful."
 mf_positive_personality.4.b: "Perhaps their artistic talents shall bring us prestige."
 mf_positive_personality.4.c: "They can gather intelligence from foreign diplomats."
 mf_positive_personality.5.t: "An Extravagant Fleet"
 mf_positive_personality.5.desc: "Every year, our coffers are consistently strained by the lavish and extravagant spending of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] on seemingly superficial things. However, for once it seems that this extra spending has paid off. While our fleets are not the most impressive in the world, our ruler's insistence on covering them with expensive decorations and equipping our navy with the finest of maritime weaponry even in peacetime has accidentally intimidated our enemies. Our rivals believe us to be more capable at sea than we really are, and our navy looks more threatening and more powerful than theirs, even if the difference is mostly negligible outside of the amount of gold and luster."
 mf_positive_personality.5.a: "Some things may have unintended, though welcome, effects."
 mf_positive_personality.6.t: "The Suggestion Box"
 mf_positive_personality.6.desc: "The impartial nature of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is appreciated by almost all of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] courtiers and officials. Always open to new ideas as well as hearing out both sides of every argument, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken it a step further through the implementation of a suggestion box. Now any offical or courtier can submit their suggestions, grievances or comments completely anonymously, allowing our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to judge each contribution completely impartially, without a name, a face or social status attached to the advice."
 mf_positive_personality.6.a: "A simple yet clever system!"
 mf_positive_personality.7.t: "A Monument to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 mf_positive_personality.7.desc: "Thanks to the benevolent and evenhanded rule of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the people of [monument_by_people_target.GetName] have constructed a monument to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], a statue of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self using whatever materials they could acquire. Although not a perfect depiction, the kindhearted [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] nonetheless appreciated the gesture, and the populace of [monument_by_people_target.GetName] was overjoyed to receive thanks for their esteemed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mf_positive_personality.7.a: "A wonderful gift from the commonfolk!"
 
 
 #Negative personalities
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME1:0 "Suspected Bastard?"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC1:0 "Rumors around the court say that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s consort has been unfaithful to him. These rumors are damaging enough to our reputation, but the situation has gotten worse now that a child has been born with questionable origins. Although it is not certain that he is a bastard child, the rumors of our consort has already convinced many that it is so... and, unfortunately, some evidence does indeed line up in support of this rumor. All we can do now is accept the child as our heir or deny him the right of succession."   
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA1:0 "Tis only court gossip..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB1:0 "No bastard shall be an heir of mine!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC1:0 "We can allay their suspicions."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME2:0 "An Inferior Castle"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC2:0 "Word has reached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ears regarding our rival's grand castle. Our diplomats report that their castle's impressive size and beauty impress all ambassadors who arrive at its gates. While this has little to do with the actual defenses of the castle, it seems that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become greatly irritated from this news; in fact, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has already begun drafting a new castle."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA2:0 "This cannot stand!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB2:0 "A few additions shouldn't hurt..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC2:0 "Trivial things must be ignored."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME3:0 "A Lax Military"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC3:0 "The kind and easygoing nature of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has caused our armies to become soft and lax, and even some of our finest generals are falling into the trap of luxury and indulgence. While this sort of easygoing personality is what allows our soldiers to be fully content and completely loyal to our state, it will bring great harm to our military power and efficiency in battle. Therefore, drastic measures must be taken to whip our armies back into shape."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA3:0 "Something must be done!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB3:0 "It can't be helped..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC3:0 "Surely, we can do much more!"
